You can find the latest version [here](https://github.com/Azulia888/Lunar-Inventory/releases)

## App Description

This is a simple app to help my friends handle their stocks at conventions, because paper is limited and keeping track on square or sumup is even more of a pain. 

### Home

The Home screen displays the user's items and categories. When clicking on a category, it brings you to a screen displaying what is inside that category. \
An item has two buttons under it : Normal Sale and Custom Sale.\
Pressing Normal Sale records a sale for that item at its normal, default price.\
Pressing Custom Sale brings you to a screen where the user can choose the exact price for the sale. Some options are displayed by default : Gift, 50% off, 25% off and 75% off. You can also input a exact price.

### Export Sales

On this super cool screen, you can export your recent sales to either a PDF, or a CSV file (btw, a CSV is what you use for Excel import). You can choose the export's name, but also what to export.\
Sales are recorded in batches, and can be ended (or not) when exporting it. This allows to separate sales for different days or events. You can also decide to export all the sales currently recorded, regardless of batch.\
One possible usage is making 1 batch equivalent to 1 day, and 1 full export equivalent to 1 convention.\
If you want to separate conventions (or idk what you want to use it for), you can reset all the sales ever done with the last button on the burger menu. This does not remove your items and categories. This can be useful for combining multiple batches together with a full export, but not have it go back forever.

### Export history and re-export

This also very useful option keeps track of all the exports you've done, and allows you to either delete them, or re-export them to whatever format you want. Even if you lost your files, you can get them back!

### Adding an item

On the menu burger (i swear that's the name), the second option is adding an item. Pressing this leads to a new screen allowing the user to add an item to the app. \
There are a few fields to fill : the item's name, the item's price, its current stock (optional and purely aesthetic), and its category (of course, also optional). \
If a category is chosen, the user may use that category's base price.\
An image can also be chosen from the phone.

### Adding a category

The third option is adding a category. Very similar to adding an item; name, parent category, and choosing an image.\
You can also set a default price, which is thus used for its items using that default price.\
By the way, for categories in categories, item price sync, the item refers to the its closest category with a default price.

### Editing/Deleting items/categories

On the home screen, you can find 3 dots on the corner of every items and categories. With those, you can either edit or delete the item/category. Deleting it removes it from the home screen. This does not remove sale of that item/category, and those will still be exported.\
Editing allows you to change whatever you want about the chosen item/category.

### Sale history

Next option is showing the last sales done. You can press the bin icon if you want to PERMANENTLY delete that sale. It will NOT show on future exports.

## Known Issues

 - Sub-categories don't show up when adding an item, but they DO show up when editing one.
 - Using very big pictures can make the app crash.
 - Changing prices can make funky things happen on the export (like saying an item is -150% off) (values are exact just shown weirdly)

(idk if/when i'll fix those but the more there are the likelier it is for me to be motivated to fix them)
